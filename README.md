# Smart-Attendance-System-using-Face-Recognition
The Smart Attendance System (SMS) is to process live video-stream of students entering their classroom and generate the list of students attending the class using Face recognition.
The modules in this Project are main.py, Cascade/haarcascade_frontalface_default, student_detail, train.py, facial_recognition.py and attendace.py.
